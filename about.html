            He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Catholic, 
            he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute to his grandmother.</p>

            <p>Is Leo Messi shy?
                As Messi is a shy person, just like any other introvert, he also prefers texting rather than a call. So, if you are
                 planning to contact the talented player, it is better that you do not make a call. Lionel Messi is viewed as perhaps 
                 the best footballer on the planet.

                <p>Why is Leo Messi short?</p> 
                 <p>Image result for leo messi</p> 
                   Messi was diagnosed with a growth hormone disorder, or GHD. It is often called idiopathic short stature,
                    but there are problems that go beyond being shorter than average. The treatments were expensive, a
                     $900 monthly expense that his modest family could not afford.

                     Is Leo Messi a Spanish citizen?
                      In 2005 he was granted Spanish citizenship, an honour greeted with mixed feelings by the fiercely Catalan supporters
                       of Barcelona. The next year Messi and Barcelona won the Champions League (the European club championship) title.
